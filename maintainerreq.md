# To become an official maintainer for Project Radiant:

Before you apply to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few things:

1. You **MUST** own the device. Blind and untested builds aren't allowed. Unified, and devices with minimal hardware changes are also allowed to be maintained.

2. You must have basic git (cherry-pick, squash, etc) knowledge.

3. You must have a daily drivable **unofficial build released at least 1 week** before applying for official.

4. **ALL** of your trees **MUST** be open source for us to check and in the future upload to devices org.

5. You **MUST** be SELinux enforcing (Exceptions can be made for legacy devices or for other reasons).

6.  Prebuilt kernels are only allowed **if your device does not have proper kernel sources**., You **MUSTN'T** ship a prebuilt kernel if you have working kernel sources available just because you save 5 minutes of build time.

7. You **MUST** meet all requirements as mentioned [here](requirements.md).

If all is well, you may apply [here](https://github.com/Spark-Rom/official_devices/issues/new/choose)
